> **§ 1 Warning about Content**  
>   
> The free and freely accessible content of this website has been created with the greatest possible care. However, the provider of this website does not guarantee the accuracy and timeliness of the provided free and freely accessible journalistic guides and news. Contributions identified by name reflect the opinion of the respective author and not always the opinion of the provider. Merely accessing the free and freely accessible content does not establish any contractual relationship between the user and the provider, as there is a lack of the provider's intent to be legally bound.

‍

> **§ 2 External Links**  
> ‍  
> This website contains links to third-party websites ("external links"). These websites are the responsibility of the respective operators. The provider checked the external content for possible legal violations when first linking the external links. At that time, no legal violations were apparent. The provider has no influence on the current and future design and content of the linked pages. Setting external links does not mean that the provider adopts the content behind the reference or link as its own. Continuous monitoring of external links by the provider, without specific indications of legal violations, is not reasonable. However, if legal violations become known, such external links will be deleted immediately.
