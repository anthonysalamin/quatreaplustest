Diving Dahab | Impressions
==========================

‍

Diving for the very first time, in the northern tip of the Red Sea, has been a mesmerizing experience which brought a whole new perspective on how beautifully meditative and fragile the underwater world is, and how small we really are. Main diving locations include "Morray Garden", "Islands", "Bells" "Canyon" and "Light House". Shot on a GoPro 4 Black Edition @ 80 frames per second, slowed down to 30% of its original speed + post-production footage stabilisation & basic lumetri color corrections. Additonal footage shot on a Canon 7D / 16 - 35 mm lens.
