Otjozondjupa
============

‍

In 2015, I left home and family to travel South Africa. The original idea, was to head south-west to explore the Cederberg mountains but instead, ended up cruising the Atlantic ocean coast of Namibia and part of the Namib desert with a fellow traveler met by chance in Johannesburg. Here are some impressions put together of the landscapes seen through our travel from the southern red dunes of Sossusvlei to the foggy Skeleton Coast, from the unique granite formation of Spitzkoppe to the wild fields of Etosha National Park. Thankful for all the amazing souls met there who helped us get through our journey.
